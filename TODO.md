# Project Tasks to Complete

- Agree on any cleaning/preprocessing steps (Scaling, missing data, etc), (Do careful scaling for each feature for each clustering method)
- PCA
- Data Interpolation with PCA (Matrix Completion)
- K-Means Clustering (With tuning k and initialization, plots)
- Hierarchical Clustering (with tuning k, all three linkage types from slides, plot dendograms)
